# JavaScript Skill-Testing Game

## Description

This is a simple, 5 question quiz built with JavaScript to test a users knowledge of JavaScript. 

In this challenge I learned about arrays, their key/object pairs, and how to use them to validate and index a users input to display if the user was correct or incorrect in response to a questions. 

I also learned a lot about inner HTML, as well as the drawbacks of using this method later on when using CSS to style the page. 

I furthered by knowledge of functions, methods, arrays, and more throughout this project.
